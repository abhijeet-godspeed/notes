   - Configure testing frameworks and dependencies
   - Set up test databases and mock services
   - Initialize CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

**2. Write One Test File**
   - Create a single, focused test file for specific functionality
   - Include comprehensive test cases and edge cases
   - Follow best practices for test structure and naming

**3. Write Multiple Test Files**
   - Generate a complete test suite for a feature or module
   - Organize tests by functionality and priority
   - Ensure proper test coverage across components

**4. Fix Broken Tests**
   - Analyze and diagnose failing tests
   - Implement fixes while maintaining test integrity
   - Update test assertions and expectations as needed

**5. Sync Code Changes and Add Tests for Them**
   - Review recent code modifications
   - Identify areas requiring new or updated tests
   - Maintain test-code synchronization
